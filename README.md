## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system before running the project:

- **Node.js** (v12 or above)  
  [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

- **npm** (v6 or above)  
  Comes with Node.js. If not installed, you can install it via [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   If you haven't already cloned the project, run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install all necessary Node modules listed in `package.json`.

## Running the Application

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be accessible in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

If you want to expose the React application to your local network, you can run it with the `--host` flag:

```bash
npm start -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

This will allow other devices on the same network to access the app using your machine's IP address.

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build of the application, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `build/` folder with the production-ready code. You can deploy this folder to any static site hosting service.
